                        <p> Brackeys is a well-known and beloved YouTube channel about game development.
                        They have tutorials for a wide range of technical concepts across a variety of platforms (particularly 
                        <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>), but they have design-oriented tutorials as well.
                        </p>

                        <p> I became familiar with Brackeys long before I learned how to code. Their content
                            definitely has entertainment value -- particularly the less-technical design
                            videos -- so it's worth checking out even if you're not interested in game
                            development.
                        </p>

                        <p> GMTK, or Game Maker's Toolkit, is a YouTube channel focused on "game design, level
                            design, and game production," according to their channel description. I didn't use
                            GMTK as a resource during the project, but they hosted the 
                            <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025">game jam</a> my friend and I
                            made the game for, which is why I include them.
                        </p>

                        <p> I've watched GMTK for several years as pure entertainment. I'm enough of a fan to have
                            kept up with previous jams, so it was really cool to participate in one! I enjoy
                            playing games, watching other people play games, and listening to other people talk
                            about games. Making one is a natural next step for me, and one I've wanted to take for
                            a long time.

                        <p> LearnCode.academy is a YouTube channel focused on web development tutorials. They
                            cover a variety of concepts including (but not limited to) APIs, languages, and
                            libraries. Their last video was posted in April of 2022, so I don't know if they're
                            still active.

                        <p> W3Schools hosts web development resources, tutorials, and exercises for learners.
                            They also offer paid courses and certifications. They were not the only text-based
                            resource I used as I made the project, but they were the only one I visited
                            consistently, which is why I list them here.

                                in fact. Participants must make a game within the 5-day
                                time window according to a theme (2025's theme was "loop").
                                Entries are ranked by the public, and the highest-ranking
                                ones are judged by GMTK.
