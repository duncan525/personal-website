        <div id="intro_text" class = "p1 panel">
            <p>I made this project in Godot, a free and open-source game engine. I ran into a lot
                of interesting programming, design, and integration challenges over the course of
                development. I don't have the space to show them all off, so I picked a few highlights
                to talk about.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned a lot about the way to structure a large project like this, at least as far
                as Godot is concerned. Some scripts are so large as to be unwieldy, for example -- 
                I should have split different major functionalities across multiple player scripts, for
                example.
            </p>

            <p> Still, I'm proud of what I've put together. I want to make another game in the future
                with the skills and knowledge I picked up making this one. I expect the repository
                will be easier to pick through, at least.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="p1 panel hide">
            <p> The player script is one of the central pivots of game functionality. Almost every 
                system (save/load, enemy behavior, doors and buttons, etc.) links back to this script
                by necessity.
            </p>

            <p> Fundamentally, it's made of chains of conditionals that trigger state changes based on
                user input and the state of the game on the current frame. For example, if the player 
                takes damage, conditional logic determines how health is decremented, whether the 
                respawn system should activate, and how the UI should change.
            </p>

            <p> Player state plays a major role in how the script responds to input from the user or
                from game elements. If the "wall_grab" input is pressed near a wall or ceiling, for 
                example, the player object will only respond to certain types of user input. The 
                WALL_CLIMB state is disabled upon release of the "wall_grab" input, distance from 
                a wall or ceiling, or damage from an enemy. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p1 panel hide">
            <p> Enemies and their behavior were some of the most fun and interesting parts of 
                development! The main difficulty is to create something that's easy for the user to 
                interpret, but poses an interesting challenge to play around. I won't claim every
                enemy lives up to those ideals, but they still guided the way I approached design.
            </p>

            <p> Some of the biggest challenges I faced during development came from enemies and the way 
                they interacted with the game world. For example, "spitters" (cannonlike enemies in
                the lava-themed area) seem to have a deep hatred for conveyor belts and walls. They like
                to get stuck inside the wall next to a conveyor or fall off the edge.
            </p>

            <p> Two enemies that I'm particularly happy with are the exploding fishlike creatures in the
                sky area and the lava snakes in the lava-themed area. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p1 panel hide">
            <p> I learned how to make a save/load system from looking at how my friend set up the one for
                <em>Sodfather</em>.
            </p>
            <p> I create an instance of Godot's ConfigFile object and use its set_value()
                method to write data from variables that hold important information about the game's current
                state. Later, that data is read from the ConfigFile and put back into those variables. This 
                functionality is split across a few functions that also allow for changing save files and 
                resetting save data.
            </p>

            <p> The whole system lives in the Global script, which provides a space to coordinate interactions
                between game systems and store important information. Some of the most important systems in the
                game (i.e., opening/closing doors, keeping track of collectibles, changing scenes) are linked 
                strongly to this script.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="intro_text 2" class = "p2 panel hide">
            <p> This game is what a friend and I came up with for the
                <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025">GMTK Game Jam 2025</a>. The theme was "loop," so we
                thought we could do something that relates to the life cycle of a plant.
            </p>

            <p> The basic premise is that, over the course of a 20 second loop, the player will go through 4
                life stages, each with its own abilities and drawbacks. During one stage, they can "germinate,"
                or lay a seed, as long as they have both a nutrient and a water resource. On the next cycle,
                the player will respawn from that point.
            </p>

            <p> The project was uploaded and content-complete in 3 days. We spent the rest of the jam (the last
                couple days) fixing bugs remotely after my partner had to leave.
            </p>

            <p> It was a fun culmination of the weeks I spent learning Godot and GDScript! </p>
