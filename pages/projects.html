        <div id="intro_text" class = "p1 panel">
            <p>I made this project in Godot, a free and open-source game engine. I ran into a lot
                of interesting programming, design, and integration challenges over the course of
                development. I don't have the space to show them all off, so I picked a few highlights
                to talk about.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned a lot about the way to structure a large project like this, at least as far
                as Godot is concerned. Some scripts are so large as to be unwieldy, for example -- 
                I should have split different major functionalities across multiple player scripts, for
                example.
            </p>

            <p> Still, I'm proud of what I've put together. I want to make another game in the future
                with the skills and knowledge I picked up making this one. I expect the repository
                will be easier to pick through, at least.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="p1 panel hide">
            <p> The player script is one of the central pivots of game functionality. Almost every 
                system (save/load, enemy behavior, doors and buttons, etc.) links back to this script
                by necessity.
            </p>

            <p> Fundamentally, it's made of chains of conditionals that trigger state changes based on
                user input and the state of the game on the current frame. For example, if the player 
                takes damage, conditional logic determines how health is decremented, whether the 
                respawn system should activate, and how the UI should change.
            </p>

            <p> Player state plays a major role in how the script responds to input from the user or
                from game elements. If the "wall_grab" input is pressed near a wall or ceiling, for 
                example, the player object will only respond to certain types of user input. The 
                WALL_CLIMB state is disabled upon release of the "wall_grab" input, distance from 
                a wall or ceiling, or damage from an enemy. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p1 panel hide">
            <p> Enemies and their behavior were some of the most fun and interesting parts of 
                development! The main difficulty is to create something that's easy for the user to 
                interpret, but poses an interesting challenge to play around. I won't claim every
                enemy lives up to those ideals, but they still guided the way I approached design.
            </p>

            <p> Some of the biggest challenges I faced during development came from enemies and the way 
                they interacted with the game world. For example, "spitters" (cannonlike enemies in
                the lava-themed area) seem to have a deep hatred for conveyor belts and walls. They like
                to get stuck inside the wall next to a conveyor or fall off the edge.
            </p>

            <p> Two enemies that I'm particularly happy with are the exploding fishlike creatures in the
                sky area and the lava snakes in the lava-themed area. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p1 panel hide">
            <p> I learned how to make a save/load system from looking at how my friend set up the one for
                <em>Sodfather</em>.
            </p>
            <p> I create an instance of Godot's ConfigFile object and use its set_value()
                method to write data from variables that hold important information about the game's current
                state. Later, that data is read from the ConfigFile and put back into those variables. This 
                functionality is split across a few functions that also allow for changing save files and 
                resetting save data.
            </p>

            <p> The whole system lives in the Global script, which provides a space to coordinate interactions
                between game systems and store important information. Some of the most important systems in the
                game (i.e., opening/closing doors, keeping track of collectibles, changing scenes) are linked 
                strongly to this script.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="intro_text 2" class = "p2 panel hide">
            <p> This game is what a friend and I came up with for the
                <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025">GMTK Game Jam 2025</a>. The theme was "loop," so we
                thought we could do something that relates to the life cycle of a plant.
            </p>

            <p> The basic premise is that, over the course of a 20 second loop, the player will grow through 3
                life stages, each with its own abilities and drawbacks. During one stage, they can "germinate,"
                or lay a seed, as long as they have both a nutrient and a water resource. On the next cycle,
                the player will respawn from that point.
            </p>

            <p> The project was uploaded and content-complete in 3 days. We spent the rest of the jam (the last
                couple days) fixing bugs remotely after my partner had to leave.
            </p>

            <p> It was a fun culmination of the weeks I spent learning Godot and GDScript! </p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="p2 panel hide">
            <p> The loop system is the central axis of the game. It's split into three stages: sprout,
                sapling, and tree. Sprouts can fit through small spaces, but they can't jump. Saplings
                can jump and germinate a seed, but can't fit through small spaces. Trees are immobile, but
                serve as platforms on the next loop cycle.
            </p>

            <p> In code, the loop system's functionality is split between two objects: &lt;time_bar&gt;, which
                is a UI element that also keeps track of the loop time, and &lt;character&gt;, which is the playable
                character. Every frame, &lt;character&gt; retrieves the time from &lt;time_bar&gt; and uses it to determine
                whether or not to change its state to a new stage.
            </p>

            <p> The player character is essentially a bunch of layered collision boxes attached to a script.
                The script determines what collision to enable depending on the player's state.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p2 panel hide">
            <p> Death happens when touching a hazard or ending a loop without germinating. Collecting
                both a water and a nutrient resource is required to germinate. Germination can only happen
                in the &lt;STAGES.SAPLING&gt; state.
            </p>

            <p> There are two special objects, &lt;placed_seed&gt; and &lt;placed_tree&gt;, that ensure
                a seamless transition between death and respawning.
            </p>

            <p> &lt;placed_seed&gt;, identical to the first 
                frame of the player's respawn animation, instantiates when the player presses the "set_seed"
                key and is removed on respawn. That way, the seed that appears upon germination seems like 
                it sprouts into a new player character on loop reset.
            </p>

            <p> &lt;placed_tree&gt; instantiates just before the loop resets,
                which makes it appear that the player character left behind its old body as a platform.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p2 panel hide">
            <p> Levels are designed around the loop mechanic and a handful of puzzle elements. Puzzle 
                elements (including &lt;nutrient_resource&gt;, &lt;water_resource&gt;, &lt;geyser&gt;,
                &lt;rock&gt;, and &lt;river&gt;) force the player into a particular path around the
                level.
            </p>

            <p> The player's ability to traverse the level is limited by &lt;time_bar&gt; and each stage.
                Much of the gameplay revolves around finding enough resource elements in time to germinate
                and avoid death. The end of each loop is important as well: &lt;placed_tree&gt; is a platform
                that is often required to progress. Ensuring its correct placement under the time restriction
                provides some excitement and pressure (we hoped).
            </p>

            <p> &lt;geyser&gt; and &lt;rock&gt; work as a lock-and-key system. Trigger the geyser to remove
                the rock preventing progression. &lt;river&gt; does less to restrict traversal and is used
                less often.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "p3 panel hide">
            <p> I first created this website as a required project when I joined BU's chapter of 
                <a href="https://upe.acm.org/"> Upsilon Pi Epsilon</a>. I wanted to try something totally
                foreign to me, so I settled on learning enough HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make a small
                personal website.
            </p>

            <p> I expected to spend much more time with the Javascript code, but it turns out that CSS <s>wants
                me to suffer</s> can be very fiddly, especially as I learn. I ended up using grid displays for
                most of the formatting.
            </p>

            <p>The main Javascript feature I wanted to implement (a comment form that will send me an email)
                needs backend work, which was outside the initial scope of the project. That feature, along
                with dynamic resizing support, will come later.
            </p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="p3 panel hide">
            <p> To come up with the design for each page, I started by drawing on a blank piece of paper.
                It seemed like the easiest way to implement those designs would be with a series of &lt;div&gt;
                tags, each with its own grid display.
            </p>

            <p> I managed to implement the designs this way without much compromise, but the formatting breaks
                quickly as the window's aspect ratio changes. I'm sure part of the issue comes from the
                uncoordinated mess of units I used to define the sizes of each grid. They make it difficult to
                predict how the page will react to resizing.
            </p>

            <p> At the moment, I plan to fix the resizing problem by just defining a different, more
                flexible layout for whatever pixel width first breaks the formatting. As I figure that out, I
                hope I'll come upon some new information that helps ease the initial problem.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p3 panel hide">
            <p> I use Javascript when I reach the limit of CSS's ability to respond to user input (at least
                as far as I'm aware of the limitations). For example, the dropdowns on the left side of the
                home page use Javascript to modify CSS properties in response to a click.
            </p>

            <p> I also use it for the buttons that loop through images or text. I index into certain arrays
                that contain references to whatever information I want to display based on which button is
                clicked. For example, clicking on the buttons in the center window of this page will update
                where the &lt;project_screenshots&gt; array is indexed. That information determines which
                image is not hidden and is therefore visible.
            </p>

            <p> As far as I'm aware, I'll also use Javascript whenever I implement the backend features I
                need for the comment form on the home page.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p3 panel hide">
            <p> The three major features I need to implement for the website to be done are dynamic resizing,
                a working comment form, and the final two pages.
            </p>

            <p> In the tutorials I used to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I learned about certain CSS rules
                that change which code is used for formatting at certain pixel widths. I'll look into that more
                when I implement dynamic resizing.
            </p>

            <p> As I've mentioned before, the comment form needs some backend functionality to work properly.
                At the moment, pressing "submit" will log an array with whatever the values of each input
                field are. I plan to use those values to generate well-organized, readable text that'll form
                the content of the email I receive. 
            </p>

            <p> I want to include a "credits" page so I can list the resources I used in the development of
                each project. For example, I used certian tutorials from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/
                @Brackeys">Brackeys</a> to learn how to work with Godot and GDScript. I think people should
                get credit for putting out free, high-quality tutorials that enable people like me to learn
                new things.
            </p>

            <p> I'm not sure what the second new page will contain. If I can't figure that part
                out, I'll scrap it. </p>
