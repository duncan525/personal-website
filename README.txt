Important limitations:

1. I haven't set up GitHub pages for hosting, so you'll have to run the site locally if you want to see it (I used an extension called "live server" to run it from vscode)
2. There are only two pages at the moment
3. I haven't made CSS rules for responsive design, so the formatting breaks quickly when the aspect ratio is too small

Brief comments:

I had a lot of fun working on this project! It'll be awesome to have a website like this once I finish the process of getting it hosted. There's still some major missing functionality, so it'll be a continuing project for a while. This is the first time I've touched anything related to web development, so I'm excited to see where things go from here.
