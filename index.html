                    Welcome to my website! I'm Luke Duncan, a sophomore at Boston University. I study computer
                    science with minors in public policy analysis and data science.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was born in New Orleans, but I grew up in South Carolina. I enjoy running and lifting,
                    learning languages, and spending time outside in the sunshine. I'll also pick up a trumpet
                    on occasion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I haven't figured out what part of computer science I'm most interested in yet. I'm curious
                    about AI, though. I'll pursue that subject on my own time for now.

                <p class="dropdown_title"><strong>WHY COMPUTER SCIENCE?</strong></p>
                <p id="dropdown1_content"> In high school, I looked for a major that could lead to a
                    flexible, high-paying career that isn't necessarily tied to one location. I had no computer
                    science experience before I started college, so it's lucky that I've enjoyed the major
                    so far! It looks like there'll be many interesting problems to solve and fun new things to
                    learn down the road from here.
                </p>

            <div id="dropdown2" class="dropdown">
                <p class="dropdown_title"><strong>WHY THE MINORS?</strong></p>
                <p id="dropdown2_content"> I haven't started my minor-specific coursework yet, so my choices
                    are a little naive. I feel like the data science minor would give me a useful skillset 
                    to supplement my major. The public policy analysis minor scratches my ever-present
                    politics/policy itch. I hope that, between my major and minors, I can get a better
                    understanding of the way public policy initiatives grapple with the era of big data and
                    generative AI.

                <p class="dropdown_title"><strong>MORE ON MY HOBBIES</strong></p>
                <p id="dropdown3_content"> I feel validated that you're curious about this part. I've been 
                    lifting and running since 2023 (me and my besties all started out together!). After I 
                    finished Spanish III in 10th grade, I took a personal interest and started learning on 
                    my own. Later, I used what I had learned to branch out to Portuguese. I live for my hobbies
                    and personal projects, so I like to take them as far as I feel I can push them. You can see 
                    some of the fruits in the "Certifications" panel to the right.
